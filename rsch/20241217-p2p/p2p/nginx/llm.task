- main task - reverse proxy for:
  - grafana 
  - prometheus 
- make implementation reverse proxy on Go
  - listen on port 82
  - all sub url like grafana/login and etc. must work
  - all security credentials must be passed from client to backend (copy needed http headers with token and etc...)
  - prometheus have 3 upstreams
    - if upstream  not available - use next and next.


- Now add 6 containers with app
  - 2 container on each host 
  - containers has names:
    - vvm1
    - vvm2
    - vvm3
    - vvm4
    - vvm5
    - vvm6
- I need reverse proxy that will distribute request by this rules
  - get url, url looks like http://host:port/api/sigma/nestor/140737488486400/q.nestor.ReportMeasure
  - extract number from url, in this example - 140737488486400
  - calculate upstream by formula crc32(140737488486400)%6
  - result - number 0..5
  - get upstream hostname: vvm + (result+1)
  - handle requst with typical appoach for reverse proxy
- Current code
