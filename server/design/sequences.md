# Sequences

## Motivation

As of March 1, 2025, the sequence implementation has several critical limitations that impact system performance and scalability:

- **Unbound Memory Growth**: Sequence data for all workspaces is loaded into memory simultaneously, creating a direct correlation between memory usage and the number of workspaces. This approach becomes unsustainable as applications scale.

- **Prolonged Startup Times**: During command processor initialization, a resource-intensive "recovery process" must read and process the entire PLog to determine the last used sequence numbers. This causes significant startup delays that worsen as event volume grows.

The proposed redesign addresses these issues through intelligent caching, background updates, and optimized storage mechanisms that maintain sequence integrity while dramatically improving resource utilization and responsiveness.

## Introduction

This document outlines the design for sequence number management within the Voedger platform.

A **Sequence** in Voedger is defined as a monotonically increasing series of numbers. The platform provides a unified mechanism for sequence generation that ensures reliable, ordered number production.

As of March 1, 2025, Voedger implements four specific sequence types using this mechanism:

- **PLogOffsetSequence**: Tracks write positions in the PLog
  - Starts from 1
- **WLogOffsetSequence**: Manages offsets in the WLog
  - Starts from 1
  - To read all events by SELECT
- **CRecordIDSequence**: Generates unique identifiers for CRecords
  - Starts from 322685000131072
    - [https://github.com/voedger/voedger/blob/ae787d43bf313f8e3119b8b2ce73ea43969eaaa3/pkg/istructs/utils.go#L35](https://github.com/voedger/voedger/blob/ae787d43bf313f8e3119b8b2ce73ea43969eaaa3/pkg/istructs/utils.go#L35)
  - Motivation:
    - Efficient CRecord caching on the DBMS side (Most CRecords reside in the same partition)
    - Simple iteration over CRecords
- **OWRecordIDSequence**: Provides sequential IDs for ORecords/WRecords (OWRecords)
  - Starts from 322680000131072
  - There are a potentially lot of such records, so it is not possible to use SELECT to read all of them

As the Voedger platform evolves, the number of sequence types is expected to expand. Future development will enable applications to define their own custom sequence types, extending the platform's flexibility to meet diverse business requirements beyond the initially implemented system sequences.

These sequences ensure consistent ordering of operations, proper transaction management, and unique identification across the platform's distributed architecture. The design prioritizes performance and scalability by implementing an efficient caching strategy and background updates that minimize memory usage and recovery time.

#### Previous flow

- Recovery on the first request into the workspace
  - CP creates new `istructs.IIDGenerator` instance [here](https://github.com/voedger/voedger/blob/9d400d394607ef24012dead0d59d5b02e2766f7d/pkg/processors/command/impl.go#L136)
  - the `istructs.IIDGenerator` instance is kept for the WSID
  - `istructs.IIDGenerator` instance is tuned with the data from the each event of the PLog:
    - for each CUD:
      - CUD.ID is set as the current RecordID
        - `IIDGenerator.UpdateOnSync` is called [here](https://github.com/voedger/voedger/blob/9d400d394607ef24012dead0d59d5b02e2766f7d/pkg/processors/command/impl.go#L253)
- save the event after cmd exec:
  - `istructs.IIDGenerator` instance is provided to `IEvents.PutPlog()` [here](https://github.com/voedger/voedger/blob/9d400d394607ef24012dead0d59d5b02e2766f7d/pkg/processors/command/impl.go#L307)
  - `istructs.IIDGenerator.Next()` is called to convert rawID->realID for ODoc in arguments and each resulting CUD [here](https://github.com/voedger/voedger/blob/9d400d394607ef24012dead0d59d5b02e2766f7d/pkg/istructsmem/event-types.go#L189)

## Definitions

**APs**: Applcation Partitions

**SequencesTrustLevel**:

The `SequencesTrustLevel` setting determines how events and table records are written.

| Level | Events, write mode | Table Records, write mode |
|-------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| 0     | InsertIfNotExists  | InsertIfNotExists         |
| 1     | InsertIfNotExists  | Put                       |
| 2     | Put                | Put                       |

## Analysis

### Sequencing strategies

As of March 1, 2025, record ID sequences may overlap, and only 5,000,000,000 IDs are available for OWRecords, since OWRecord IDs start from 322680000131072, while CRecord IDs start from 322685000131072.

Solutions:

- **One sequence for all records**:
  - Pros:
    - 👍Clean for Voedger users
    - 👍IDs are more human-readable
    - 👍Simpler Command Processor
  - ❌Cons: CRecords are not cached efficiently
    - Solution: Let the State read copies of CRecords from sys.Collection, or possibly from an alternative optimized storage to handle large CRecord data
      - ❌Cons: Why we need CRecords then
      - 👍Pros: Separation of write and read models
- **Keep as is**:
  - Pros
    - 👍Easy to implement
  - Cons
    - ❌ No separation between write and read models
    - ❌ Only 5 billions of OWRecords (ClusterAsRegisterID < ClusterAsCRecordRegisterID)
      - Solution: Configure sequencer to use multiple ranges to avoid collisions
        - 👍Pros: Better control over sequences

### SequencesTrustLevel: Performance impact

- https://snapshots.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/zEW5AQHECtKLIcUeO2PJnmy3nkQDhp9m?orgId=0
  - Zero SequencesTrustLevel was introduced to the Air performance testbench on 2025-04-29
  - Latency is increased from 40 ms to 120 ms with spikes up to 160 ms
  - Testbench throughput reduced from 4000 command per seconds to 1400 cps
  - CPU usage is decreased from 75% to 42%
  - So we can make an educated guess that maximum thoughtput would be reduced by 4000 / 1400 * 42 / 75 = 1.6 times

## Solution overview

The proposed approach implements a more efficient and scalable sequence management system through the following principles:

- **Projection-Based Storage**: Each application partition will maintain sequence data in a dedicated projection ???(`SeqData`). SeqData is a map that eliminates the need to load all sequence data into memory at once
- **Offset Tracking**: `SeqData` will include a `SeqDataOffset` attribute that indicates the PLog partition offset for which the stored sequence data is valid, enabling precise recovery and synchronization
- **LRU Cache Implementation**: Sequence data will be accessed through a Most Recently Used (LRU) cache that prioritizes frequently accessed sequences while allowing less active ones to be evicted from memory
- **Background Updates**: As new events are written to the PLog, sequence data will be updated in the background, ensuring that the system maintains current sequence values without blocking operations
- **Batched Writes**: Sequence updates will be collected and written in batches to reduce I/O operations and improve throughput
- **Optimized Actualization**: The actualization process will use the stored `SeqDataOffset` to process only events since the last known valid state, dramatically reducing startup times

This approach decouples memory usage from the total number of workspaces and transforms the recovery process from a linear operation dependent on total event count to one that only needs to process recent events since the last checkpoint.

    - sequencer, err := IAppPartition.Sequencer(PartitionID) err
    - nextPLogOffest, ok, err := sequencer.Start(wsKind, WSID)
      - if !ok
        - Actualization is in progress

## Technical design: Tests

### Integration tests for SequencesTrustLevel mode

Method:

- Test for Record
  - Create a new VIT instance on an owned config with `VVMConfig.TrustedSequences = false`
  - Insert a doc to get the last recordID: simply exec `c.sys.CUD` and get the ID of the new record
  - Corrupt the storage: Insert a conflicting key that will be used on creating the next record:
    - `VIT.IAppStorageProvider.AppStorage(test1/app1).Put()`
   	- Build `pKey`, `cCols` for the record, use just inserted recordID+1
   	- Value does not matter, let it be `[]byte{1}`
  - Try to insert one more record using `c.sys.CUD`
  - Expect panic
- Test for PLog, WLog offsets - the same tests but sabotage the storage building keys for the event

Tests:

- `~it.SequencesTrustLevel0~`uncvrd[^27]❓: Intergation test for `SequencesTrustLevel = 0`
- `~it.SequencesTrustLevel1~`uncvrd[^28]❓: Intergation test for `SequencesTrustLevel = 1`
- `~it.SequencesTrustLevel2~`uncvrd[^29]❓: Intergation test for `SequencesTrustLevel = 2`

### Intergation tests for built-in sequences

- `~it.BuiltInSequences~`uncvrd[^30]❓: Test for initial values: WLogOffsetSequence, WLogOffsetSequence, CRecordIDSequence, OWRecordIDSequence
