# VVM Orchestration Design

## Overview

**Orchestration** in the context of clusters refers to the automated coordination, scheduling, and management of distributed workloads to optimize resource utilization, ensure reliability, and maintain desired state across multiple computing units.

## Problem Statement

Design reliable orchestration mechanism for VVM (Voedger Virtual Machine) that ensures:

- VVM goroutines work only if leadership is acquired and held
- Clean termination of all goroutines
- Concurrent-safe error handling
- Graceful shutdown capabilities

---

## Functional design

### Actors

- VVMHost: Application that starts and manages VVM
- VVM

### Use VVM

VVMHost creates a VVM instance and launches it. VVM acquires leadership and starts services. VVMHost waits for vvmProblemCtx and shuts down VVM.

```go

  // Create VVM instance
  myVVM := vvm.Provide(...)

  // Launch VVM
  vvmProblemCtx := myVVM.Launch(leadershipDuration, leadershipAcquisitionDuration)

  // Wait for `problemCtx` and optionally for other events like os.Interrupt, syscall.SIGTERM, syscall.SIGINT
  ...

  // Shutdown VVM
  // Might be called immediately after myVVM.Launch()
  err := VVM.Shutdown()

```

---

## Technical design

### Implementation requirements

- Clear ownership and cleanup responsibilities
- All error reporting must use `VVM.updateProblem`
- All algorithms must be finite
- No active goroutines should remain after VVM.Shutdown (except killerRoutine)
- No data races
- Each channel shall be closed exactly once
- Predictable error propagation
- No goroutine leaks (except the intentional killerRoutine)

### Components

- **pkg/vvm**

  ```golang
  type NumVVM uint32
  type VVMConfig {
    ...
    NumVVM NumVVM // amount of VVMs in the cluster. Default 1
    IP     net.IP // current IP of the VVM. Used as the value for leaderhsip elections
  }
  ```

- **pkg/elections**
  - Purpose: Describe and implement the interface to acquire and manage leadership for a given key
  - `IELections`
    - Purpose: Describe the interface to acquire and manage leadership for a given key
  - `elections`
    - Purpose: Implementation of IELections
  - `ITTLStorage`
    - Purpose: interface with methods InsertIfNotExist(), CompareAndSwap(), CompareAndDelete() used to persist `view.cluster.VVMLeader`
- **pkg/vvm/storage**
  - `IVVMAppTTLStorage` interface definition
  - Implementations of all possible `ITTLStorage` interfaces
    - `NewElectionsTTLStorage() elections.ITTLStorage[TTLStorageImplKey, string]`
      - uses `keyspace(sysvvm)` and keys prefixed with `pKeyPrefix_Elections = 1`
  - incapsulates and guards all possible values of `pKeyPrefix`
  - Like we had here `~VVMLeader.def~`covered[^~VVMLeader.def~]âœ…
- **pkg/vvm/impl_orch.go**, **pkg/vvm/impl_orch_test.go**
  - orchestration implementation and tests

### VVM

VVM:

- `elections.IElections`: Interface to acquire and manage leadership for a given key
- `problemCtx`. Closed by `VVM.updateProblem(err)` (e.g. leadership loss or service failure)
- `problemErrCh`. Channel that receives the error describing the problem, written only once. Content is returned on `Shutdown()`
- `problemErrOnce sync.Once` to ensure `problemErrCh` is written only once
- `vvmShutCtx`. Closed when VVM should be stopped (`Shutdown()` is called outside)
- `servicesShutCtx`. Closed when VVM services should be stopped (but `LeadershipMonitor`) (that should be context for services: `servicesShutCtx` closed -> services pipeline is stopped. Closed when `Shutdown()` is called outside)
- `monitorShutCtx`. Closed after all services are stopped and `LeadershipMonitor` should be stopped
- `shutdownedCtx`. Closed after all (services and `LeadershipMonitor`) is stopped
- `leadershipCtx`. Context for watching leadership. Closed when leadership is lost.
- `numVVM`. Number of VVMs in the cluster
- `ip`. IP address of the VVM

The error propagation follows these principles:

- Single error channel (`problemErrCh`) for reporting critical issues
- Write-once semantics using `sync.Once`
- Non-blocking error reads during shutdown
- Thread-safe error updates via `updateProblem()`

Goroutine hierarchy:

- Main (VVMHost)
  - Launcher
    - LeadershipMonitor
      - KillerRoutine
    - ServicePipeline
  - Shutdowner

Each goroutine's lifecycle is controlled by dedicated context cancellation. (except `killerRoutine`)

#### VVM.Provide()

- wire `vvm.VVM`: consturct apps, interfaces, Service Pipeline. Do not launch anything

#### VVM.Shutdown()

- close(VVM.vvmShutCtx)
- Wait for `VVM.shutdownedCtx`
- Return error from `VVM.problemErrCh`, non-blocking.

#### VVM.Launch() problemCtx

- vvmProblemCtx := VVM.Launch(leadershipAcquisitionDuration)
  - go Shutdowner
  - err := tryToAcquireLeadership()
    - construct `IElections` and store `electionsCleanup()` in VVM
    - use `IElections`
  - if err == nil
    - err = servicePipeline
  - if err != nil
    - call `VVM.updateProblem(err)`
  - return VVM.problemCtx

#### Shutdowner: go VVM.shutdowner()

- Wait for `VVM.vvmShutCtx`
- Shutdown everything but `LeadershipMonitor` and `elections`
  - close `VVM.servicesShutCtx` and wait for services to stop
- Shutdown `LeadershipMonitor` (close `VVM.monitorShutCtx` and wait for `LeadershipMonitor` to stop)
- Cleanup `elections`
  - `VVM.electionsCleanup()`
  - // Note: all goroutines will be stopped and leaderships will be released
- Close `VVM.shutdownedCtx`

#### LeadershipMonitor: go VVM.leadershipMonitor()

- wait for any of:
  - `VVM.leadershipCtx` (leadership loss)
    - go `killerRoutine`
      - After `leadershipDuration/4` seconds kills the process
      - // Never stoped, process must exit and goroutine must die
      - // Yes, this is the anti-patterm "Goroutine/Task/Thread Leak"
    - `VVM.updateProblem(leadershipLostErr)`
    - break
  - `VVM.monitorShutCtx`
    - break

#### VVM.tryToAcquireLeadership(leadershipDuration, leadershipAquisitionDuration)

- Try to acquire leadership for `leadershipDuration`
  - Leadership key is choosen in the [1, `VVM.numVVM`] interval
  - Leadership value is `VVM.ip`
  - Do not wait for `servicesShutCtx` because Launch is blocking method
  - During `leadershipAcquisitionDuration`
- If leadership is acquired
  - Set `VVM.leadershipCtx`
  - go `LeadershipMonitor`
- Else return `leadershipAcquisitionErr`

#### VVM.updateProblem(err)

- synchronized via `VVM.problemErrOnce`
  - Close `VVM.problemCtx`
  - Write error to `VVM.problemErrCh` using `VVM.problemErrOnce`

## Test design

### Automatic

- Basic
  - provide and launch VVM1
  - wait for successful VVM1 start
  - provide and launch VVM2
  - wait for VVM2 start failure
- Automatic shutdown on leadership loss
  - provide and launch a VVM
  - update `view.cluster.VVMLeader`: modify the single value
  - bump mock time
  - expect the VVM shutdown
- Cancel the leadership on manual shutdown
  - provide and launch a VVM
  - shut it down on the launcher side
  - expect that the leadership in canceled

### Manual

- docker container:
  - scylla db
  - 2 VVMs services
- `docker compse up -d`
- expect 1 of 2 VVMs services are failed to start
