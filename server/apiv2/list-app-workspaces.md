# List app workspaces
## Motivation
List app workspaces, using API

## Functional Design
GET `/api/v2/apps/{owner}/{app}/schemas`

Returns the hierarchy of non-abstract workspaces in the application with WSProfile as a root.
If Authorization header is provided, and user has `sys.Developer` role, the hierarchy of all workspaces in the application is returned.
Otherwise, only workspaces returned which have resources available to [published roles](../authnz/published-roles.md). 

### Headers
| Key | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authorization | Bearer {PrincipalToken} | optional |
| Accept | text/html | To get the response in HTML format (default) |

### Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| owner | string | name of a user who owns the application |
| app | string | name of an application |

### Result
| Code | Description | Body |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 200 | OK | app workspaces hierarchy in the selected format |
| 400 | Bad Request | [error object](conventions.md#errors) |
