# List workspace roles

## Motivation

Return the list of roles in the workspace, using API

## Functional Design

GET `/api/v2/apps/{owner}/{app}/schemas/{pkg}.{workspace}/roles`

If Authorization header is provided, and user has `sys.Developer` role, the list of all roles in the workspace is returned.
Otherwise, only [published roles](../authnz/published-roles.md) are returned.

### Headers

| Key | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authorization | Bearer {PrincipalToken} | optional |
| Accept | text/html | To get the response in HTML format (default) |

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |

### Result

| Code | Description | Body |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 200 | OK | roles in the selected format |
